2012 Aug  1: Pyxplot 0.9.0
   - Version 0.9 is a major update. Many new data types have been introduced,
     each of which has methods which can be called in an object-orientated
     fashion. These include:

      - Colors, which can be stored in variables for subsequent use in vector
        graphics commands. The addition and subtraction operators act on colors
        to allow color mixing.

      - Dates, which can be imported from calendar dates, unix times or Julian
        dates. Dates can be subtracted to give time intervals.

      - Lists and dictionaries, which can be iterated over, or used to feed
        calculated data into the plot and tabulate commands.

      - Vectors and matrices, which allow matrix algebra. These types interface
        cleanly with Pyxplot’s vector-graphics commands, allowing positions to
        be specified as vector expressions.

      - File handles, which allow Pyxplot to read data from files, or write
        data or logs to files.

      - Modules and classes, which allow object-orientated programming.

   - In addition, Pyxplot’s range of operators has been extended to include
     most of those in the C programming language, allowing expressions such as

     pyxplot> print (a=3)+(b=2)
     5
     pyxplot> print a>0?"yes":"no"
     yes
     pyxplot> print "%s %s"%(++a,b++)
     4 2
     pyxplot> print (a+=10 , b+=10 , a+b)
     27

     to be written.

   - INCOMPATIBILITIES WITH PYXPLOT 0.8.

	- Some functions and variables have been renamed. Variables whose names used
	  to begin phy_ now live in a module called phy. They may be accessed as,
     for example, phy.c. Similarly, random number generating functions now live
     in a module called random; statistics functions in a module called stats;
     time-handling functions in time; operating system functions in os; and
     astronomy functions in ast. The contents of these modules can be listed by
     typing, for example, print phy.

	- Custom colors, which used to be specified using syntax such as
	  rgb0.2:0.3:0.4, should now be specified using the rgb(r,g,b) functions,
     as, for example, rgb(0.2,0.3,0.4). Custom colors can now be stored in
     variables for later use.

	- The range of escape characters which can be used in strings has been
	  increased, so that, for example, \n is a newline and \t a tab. As in
     python, prepending the string with the character r disables all escape
     character expansion. As backslashes are common characters in latex command
     strings, the easiest approach is to always prepend latex strings with an r.
     As in python, triple quotes, e.g.\ r"""2 \times 3""" can be used where
     required.

	- In the foreach command, square brackets should be used to delimit lists of
	  items to iterate over. The Pyxplot 0.8 syntax foreach i in (1,2,3) should
     now be written foreach i in [1,2,3].

   - multiplot implemented, including linked axes, though with some brokenness
     if linked axes are allowed to autoscale.
   - 'dots' plotting style implemented.
   - Bug fix: can now include a plot 'with' clause after an 'axes' clause;
     could not previously without an error message arising.
   - Pointstyles now increment between plotted datasets, even in a colour
     terminal where the colours also increment.

2006 Apr 14: GnuPlot+ 0.3.2
   - The autoscaling of logarithmic axes made more trust-worthy: error checks
     to ensure that they do not try to cover negative ordinates.
   - Error checks put in place to prevent empty keys being plotted, which made
     PyX crash previously. Now can plot empty graphs happily.
   - Datasets with blank titles removed from the key, to allow users to plot
     some datasets to be omitted from the key. This is not possible in gnuplot.
   - Bug fix to prevent PyX's texrunner from crashing irreparably upon
     receiving bad LaTeX. Now uses a spanner to attempt to return it to working
     order for the next plot.
   - Bug fix to the autoscaling of axes with no range of data -- previous did
     not work for negative ordinates. Now displays an axes with a range of +/-
     1.0 around the data.

2006 Apr 12: GnuPlot+ 0.3.1
   - Plotting of functions fixed: plot command will now plot any algebraic
     expression, not just functions of the form f(x).

     well as in the corners of the plot. Key allowed to be offseted in position.
   - Datasets colours can be set via 'plot with colour <n>'
   - Datasets are split when there is a blank line in the datafile; lines are
     not joined up between the two segments.
   - set size implemented; can now change aspect ratio of plots.
   - working directory of GnuPlot+ changed to /tmp, so that LaTeX's temporary
     files are stored there rather than in the user's cwd.

2006 Mar 30: GnuPlot+ 0.2.0
   - Standard GnuPlot dual axes improved upon, allowing users to add x3, x4
     axes, etc, up to any number of axes that may be desired.
   - Autocomplete mechanism for commandline substantially cleaned up and
     debugged.
   - Bug fixes to the plotting of arrows/labels. Now appear *above* gridlines,
