\chapter{Color tables}
\label{ch:color_charts}

\index{colors!charts} Figures~\ref{fig:color_table1}, \ref{fig:color_table2}
and \ref{fig:color_table3} show the default named colors which Pyxplot recognises.
In addition to using these colors in statements such as

\begin{verbatim}
plot 'data' with color red
\end{verbatim}

\noindent it is also possible to make custom colors using the {\tt rgb(r,g,b)},
{\tt cmyk(c,m,y,k)}, {\tt gray(g)} and {\tt hsb(h,s,b)} functions, whose inputs
should be in the range 0--1. For example:

\begin{verbatim}
plot 'data' with color rgb(0.8,0.8,0.2)

myColor = cmyk(0.2,0.8,0.8,0.1)
plot 'data' with color myColor
\end{verbatim}

These figures also exclude the 100~shades of gray which Pyxplot recognises,
which are named from {\tt gray00} (black) to {\tt gray99} (almost white).
These shades of gray may also be spelt in the UK English form {\tt grey??}.
