\chapter{First steps with Pyxplot}
\label{ch:first_steps}

This chapter provides an overview of the commands used to produce simple plots
in Pyxplot. The commands it covers have very similar syntax to \gnuplot's
plotting commands, and have already used the latter you may find that you can
skim over this chapter. An approximate list of those features of \gnuplot\
which are either not supported, or which are substantially different in
Pyxplot, can be found in Appendix~\ref{ch:gnuplot_diffs}.

Chapter~\ref{ch:plotting} will extend the material of this chapter to provide a
complete guide to Pyxplot's plot styles.

\section{Getting started}

The simplest way to start Pyxplot is to type {\tt pyxplot} at a shell prompt.
This starts an interactive session, and a Pyxplot command-line prompt into
which commands can be typed will appear. Pyxplot can be exited either by typing
\indcmdts{exit} or \indcmdts{quit}, or by pressing CTRL-D. Various switches can
be specified on the shell command line to modify Pyxplot's behaviour; these are
listed in Box~\ref{box:CommandSwitches}.  Of especial interest may be the
switches {\tt -c} and {\tt -m}, which change between the use of
color-highlighted (default) and non-colored text.

Typing commands into interactive terminals will probably be a sufficient way to
drive Pyxplot to begin with, but as the number of commands required to set up
plots grows with the complexity of the task, it is likely to become rapidly
more preferable to store these commands in text files called scripts.  Once
such a script has been written, it can be executed automatically by passing the
filename of the command script to Pyxplot on the shell command line, for
example:\index{command-line syntax}

\begin{verbatim}
pyxplot foo.ppl
\end{verbatim}

\boxout{A list of the command line options accepted by Pyxplot.}{box:CommandSwitches}{
From the shell command line, Pyxplot accepts the following switches which
modify its behaviour:\index{command line syntax}
\vspace{0.5cm}

\begin{tabular}{p{3.0cm}p{8.3cm}}
{\tt -h --help} & Display a short help message listing the available command-line switches.\\
{\tt -v --version} & Display the current version number of Pyxplot.\\
{\tt -q --quiet} & Turn off the display of the welcome message on startup. \\
{\tt -V --verbose} & Display the welcome message on startup, as happens by default. \\
{\tt -c --color} & Use color highlighting\footnote{This will only function on terminals which support color output.}, as is the default behaviour, to display output in green, warning messages in amber, and error messages in red.\footnote{The authors apologise to those members of the population who are red/green color blind, but draw their attention to the following sentence.} These colors can be changed in the {\tt terminal} section of the configuration file; see Section~\ref{sec:configfile_terminal} for more details. \\
{\tt -m --monochrome} & Do not use color highlighting. \\
\end{tabular}
}

\noindent In this case, Pyxplot would execute the commands in the file {\tt
foo.ppl} and then exit. By convention, we choose to affix the suffix {\tt
.ppl} to the filenames of all Pyxplot command scripts. This is not strictly
necessary, but allows Pyxplot scripts to be easily distinguished from other
text files in a filing system. The filenames of several command scripts may be
passed to Pyxplot on a single command line, indicating that they should be
executed in sequence, as in the example:

\begin{verbatim}
pyxplot foo1.ppl foo2.ppl foo3.ppl
\end{verbatim}

It is also possible to have a single Pyxplot session alternate between running
command scripts autonomously and allowing the user to enter commands
interactively between the running of the scripts. There are two ways of doing
this.  Pyxplot can be passed the magic filename {\tt --} on the command line,
as in the example

\begin{verbatim}
pyxplot foo1.ppl -- foo2.ppl
\end{verbatim}

\noindent where the {\tt --} represents an interactive session which commences
after the execution of {\tt foo1.ppl} and should be terminated by the user in
the usual way, using either the \indcmdts{exit} or \indcmdts{quit} commands.
After the interactive session is finished, Pyxplot will automatically execute
the command script {\tt foo2.ppl}.

From within an interactive session, it is possible to run a command script
using the \indcmdt{load}, as in the example:

\vspace{3mm}
\noindent\texttt{pyxplot> \textbf{load 'foo.ppl'}}
\vspace{3mm}

\noindent This example would have the same effect as typing the contents of the
file {\tt foo.ppl} into the present interactive terminal.

The \indcmdt{save} may assist in producing Pyxplot command scripts: it stores a
history of the commands which have been typed into the present interactive
session to file.

\boxout{The storage of command histories in Pyxplot.}{box:CommandHistory}{
When Pyxplot is used interactively, its command-line environment is based upon
the GNU Readline Library. This means that the up- and down-arrow keys can be
used to repeat or modify previously executed commands. Each user's command
history is stored in his homespace in a history file called {\tt
.pyxplot\_history}; this file is used by Pyxplot to remember command histories
between sessions. Pyxplot's \indcmdt{save} allows the user to save to a text
file a list of the commands which have been typed into the present session, as
in the following example:\vspace{3mm}

\noindent {\tt save 'output\_filename.ppl' }\vspace{3mm}

The related \indcmdt{history} displays on the terminal a history of all of the
commands which have been typed into this and previous interactive sessions. The
total history can stretch to several hundred lines long, in which case it can
be useful to follow the \indcmdt{history} by an optional number, whereupon it
only displays the last $n$ commands, e.g.:\vspace{3mm}

\noindent {\tt history 20 }
}

\section{First plots}
\label{sec:first_plots}

The core graph-plotting command of Pyxplot is the \indcmdt{plot}. The following
simple example would plot the trigonometric function $\sin(x)$:

\begin{verbatim}
plot sin(x)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=8cm]{examples/eps/ex_intro_sine}
\end{center}

\noindent This is one of a large number of mathematical functions which are
built into Pyxplot; a complete alphabetical list of them can be found in
Chapter~\ref{ch:function_list}.

As well as plotting functions, it is also possible to plot data stored in
files. The following would plot data from a file {\tt data.dat}, taking the
$x$-coordinate of each point from the first column of the \datafile, and the
$y$-coordinate from the second.  The \datafile\ is assumed to be in plain text
format\footnote{If the filename of a \datafile\ ends with a {\tt .gz} suffix,
it is assuming to be gzipped plaintext, and is decoded accordingly. Other
formats of \datafile\ can be opened with the use of input filters; see
Section~\ref{sec:filters}.}, with columns separated by whitespace and/or
commas\footnote{This format is compatible with the Comma Separated Values (CSV)
format produced by many applications such as Microsoft Excel.}\index{csv
files}\index{spreadsheets, importing data from}\index{Microsoft
Excel}\index{gzip}:

\begin{verbatim}
plot 'data.dat'
\end{verbatim}

Several items can be plotted on the same graph by separating them by commas, as
in

\begin{verbatim}
plot 'data.dat', sin(x), cos(x)
\end{verbatim}

\noindent and it is possible to define one's own variables and functions,
and then plot them, as in the example

\begin{verbatim}
a = 0.02
b = -1
c = 5
f(x) = a*(x**3) + b*x + c
plot f(x)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=8cm]{examples/eps/ex_intro_func}
\end{center}

Pyxplot supports almost all of the same mathematical operators as the C
programming language; a complete list of them can be found in
Table~\ref{tab:operators_table}.\index{functions!pre-defined}\index{operators}
If you have experience of similar tricks in C, it is quite possible to write
the following expressions in Pyxplot (but don't worry if this is a little over
your head):

\vspace{3mm}
\input{fragments/tex/fs_operators.tex}
\vspace{3mm}

\noindent In the final example, the comma operator is used as in C, to return
only the value of the final comma-separated expression.

\label{tab:operators_table}
\end{table}

\section{Comments}

As in any programming language, it is good practice to include comments in
Pyxplot command scripts to explain what each command or block of commands is
doing. Comment lines should begin with a hash character, as in the
example\index{comment lines}\index{command scripts!comment lines}

\begin{verbatim}
# This is a comment
\end{verbatim}

\noindent Comments may also be placed on the same line as commands, as in the
example

\begin{verbatim}
set nokey # I'll have no key on _my_ plot
\end{verbatim}

\noindent In both cases, all of the characters following the hash character are
ignored.

\section{Splitting long commands}

Long commands may be split over multiple lines in scripts provided that each
line of the command is terminated with a backslash character, whereupon the
following line will be appended to it, as in this example:

\vspace{3mm}
\input{fragments/tex/fs_longline.tex}
\vspace{3mm}

\noindent Such lines splits will be used extensively in this manual where
command lines are longer than the width of the page.

\section{Printing text}

Pyxplot's \indcmdt{print} can be used to display strings and the results of
calculations on the terminal, as in the following examples:

\vspace{3mm}
\input{fragments/tex/fs_print1.tex}
\vspace{3mm}

Multiple items can be displayed one-after-another on a single line by
separating them with commas. The following example displays the values of the
variable {\tt a} and the function {\tt f(a)} in the middle of a text string:

\vspace{3mm}
\input{fragments/tex/fs_print2.tex}
\vspace{3mm}

Strings can be enclosed either in single ({\tt '}) or double ({\tt "}) quotes.
Strings may also be enclosed by three quote characters in a row: either {\tt
'''} or {\tt """}. Special care needs to be taken when using apostrophes or
quotes in single-quote delimited strings, as these characters may be
misinterpreted as string delimiters, as in the example:

\begin{dontdo}
'Robert's data'
\end{dontdo}

\noindent This easiest way to avoid such problems is to use three quotes:

\begin{dodo}
'''Robert's data'''
\end{dodo}

Special characters such as tabs and newlines can be inserted into strings using
escape codes such as {\tt $\backslash$t} and {\tt $\backslash$n}; see
Table~\ref{tab:escape_sequences} for a list of these. The following string is
split over three lines:

\vspace{3mm}
\input{fragments/tex/fs_print4.tex}
\vspace{3mm}

Sometimes these escape codes can be rather annoying, especially when entering
\LaTeX control codes, which all begin with backslash characters. Rather than
having to escape every backslash, it is generally easier to prefix the string
with the character {\tt r}, which turns off all escape codes:

\vspace{3mm}
\input{fragments/tex/fs_print5.tex}
\vspace{3mm}

It is usually neater to use the string substitution operator, {\tt \%}\index{\%
operator@{\tt \%} operator}\index{string operators!substitution}.  The operator
is preceded by a format string, in which the places where numbers and strings
are to be substituted are marked by tokens such as {\tt \%e} and {\tt \%s}. The
substitution operator is followed by a ()-bracketed list of the quantities
which are to be substituted into the format string. This behaviour is similar
to that of python's \% operator, and of the {\tt printf} command in C, as the
following examples demonstrate:

\vspace{3mm}
\input{fragments/tex/fs_print3.tex}
\vspace{3mm}

The detailed behaviour of the string substitution operator, and a full list of
the substitution tokens which it accepts, are given in
Section~\ref{sec:stringsubop}.

\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|>{\columncolor{LightGrey}}l>{\columncolor{LightGrey}}l|}
\hline
{\bf Escape sequence} & {\bf Description} \\
\hline
{\tt $\backslash$?} & Question mark \\
{\tt $\backslash$'} & Apostrophe \\
{\tt $\backslash$"} & Double quote \\
{\tt $\backslash\backslash$} & Literal backslash \\
{\tt $\backslash$a} & Bell character \\
{\tt $\backslash$b} & Backspace \\
{\tt $\backslash$f} & Formfeed \\
{\tt $\backslash$n} & Newline \\
{\tt $\backslash$r} & Carriage return \\
{\tt $\backslash$t} & Horizontal tab \\
{\tt $\backslash$v} & Vertical tab \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{A complete list of Pyxplot's string escape sequences. These are a subset of those available in C.}
\label{tab:escape_sequences}
\end{table}

\section{Axis labels and titles}
\label{sec:latex_incompatibility}

Labels can be added to the axes of a plot, and a title put at the top.  Labels
should be placed between either single (') or double (") quotes, as in the
following example script:

\begin{verbatim}
set xlabel "Horizontal axis"
set ylabel "Vertical axis"
set title 'A plot with labelled axes'
plot
\end{verbatim}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=8cm]{examples/eps/ex_axislabs}
\end{center}

\noindent These labels and title -- in fact, all text labels which are ever
produced by Pyxplot -- are rendered using the \LaTeX\ typesetting system, and
so any \LaTeX\ commands can be used to produce custom formatting. This allows
great flexibility, but means that care needs to be taken to escape any of
\LaTeX's reserved characters -- i.e. $\backslash$~\&~\%~\#~\{~\}~\$~\_~\^{} or
$\sim$.

Two built-in functions provide some assistance in generating \LaTeX\ labels.
The \indfunt{texify()} takes as its argument a string containing a mathematical
expression, and returns a \LaTeX\ representation of it.  The
\indfunt{texifyText()} takes as its argument a text string, and returns a
\LaTeX\ representation of it, with any necessary escape characters added. For
example:

\vspace{3mm}
\input{fragments/tex/fs_texify.tex}
\vspace{3mm}

Special care needs to be taken when typesetting \LaTeX\ expressions that
contain apostrophe, quote and backslash characters.  It is recommended that
\LaTeX\ expressions be enclosed in triple quotes, as raw strings with escape
characters turned off, for example:

\begin{dodo}
set xlabel r"""\textrm{J\"org's data}"""
\end{dodo}

The reason for recommending this syntax is demonstrated by the examples below,
all of which will fail. In

\begin{dontdo}
set xlabel 'My plot's X axis'
\end{dontdo}

\noindent the apostrophe will be mis-interpreted as a closing quote character. In
\index{backslash character}\index{accented characters}

\begin{dontdo}
set xlabel "J$\backslash$"org's data"
\end{dontdo}

\noindent the backslash before the " character will be interpreted as a Pyxplot escape character; it will not be passed to \LaTeX, and a \LaTeX error will result. There are similar problems with

\begin{dontdo}
set xlabel "2 $\backslash$times 3"
\end{dontdo}

\noindent where the \texttt{$\backslash$t} will be turned into a tab character. Whilst it is possible to write

\begin{verbatim}
set xlabel "2 \\times 3"
set xlabel "J\\\"org's data"
\end{verbatim}

\noindent this syntax is messy, especially in the last example where three backslashes are needed. It is much neater to use:\index{backslash character}\index{accented characters}

\begin{dodo}
set xlabel r"""2 $\backslash$times 3"""
set xlabel r"""J$\backslash$"org's data"""
\end{dodo}

Having set labels and titles, they may be removed thus:

\begin{verbatim}
set xlabel ''
set ylabel ''
set title ''
\end{verbatim}

\noindent These are two other ways of removing the title from a plot:

\begin{verbatim}
set notitle
unset title
\end{verbatim}

The \indcmdt{unset} may be followed by almost any word that can follow the {\tt
set} command, such as {\tt xlabel} or {\tt title}, to return that setting to
its default configuration. The \indcmdt{reset} restores all configurable
parameters to their default states.

\section{Querying the values of settings}

As the previous section has demonstrated, the \indcmdt{set} is used in a wide
range of ways to configure the way in which plots appear; we will meet many
more in due course. The corresponding \indcmdt{show} can be used to query the
current values of settings. To query the value of one particular setting, the
\indcmdt{show} should be followed by the name of the setting, as in the
example:

\begin{verbatim}
show title
\end{verbatim}

\noindent Alternatively, several settings may be requested at once, or all
settings beginning with a certain string of characters can be queried, as in
the following two examples:

\begin{verbatim}
show xlabel ylabel key
show g
\end{verbatim}

\noindent The special keyword {\tt settings} may be used to display the values
of all settings which can be set with the {\tt set} command. A list of other
special keywords which the \indcmdt{show} accepts is given in
Table~\ref{tab:show_keywords}.

\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|>{\columncolor{LightGrey}}l>{\columncolor{LightGrey}}p{9cm}|}
\hline
{\bf Query} & {\bf Description} \\ \hline
{\tt all} & Lists all settings.\\
{\tt axes} & Lists all of the currently configured axes.\\
{\tt functions} & Lists all currently defined mathematical functions, both those which are built into Pyxplot and those which the user has defined.\\
{\tt settings} & Lists the current values of all settings which can be set with the {\tt set} command.\\
{\tt units} & Lists all of the physical units which Pyxplot is currently set up to recognise.\\
{\tt userfunctions} & Lists all current user-defined mathematical functions and subroutines.\\
{\tt variables} & Lists the values of all currently-defined variables.\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{The special keywords which the \indcmdt{show} recognises.}
\label{tab:show_keywords}
\end{table}

Generally, the \indcmdt{show} displays each setting in the form of a
\indcmdt{set} which could be used to set that setting, together with a comment
to briefly explain what effect the setting has. This means that the output can
be pasted directly into another Pyxplot terminal to copy settings from one
session to another. However, it should be noted that some settings, such as
{\tt papersize} are only pastable once the \indcmdt{set numerics typeable} has
been issued, for reasons which will be explained in Section~\ref{sec:pastable}.

When a color-highlighted interactive session is used, settings which have been
changed are highlighted in yellow, whilst those settings which are unchanged
from Pyxplot's default configuration, or from a user-supplied configuration
file, are shown in green.

\section{Plotting \datafile s}
\label{sec:plot_datafiles}

In the simple example of the previous section, we plotted the first column of a
\datafile\ against the second. It is possible to plot any arbitrary column of a
\datafile\ against any other; the syntax for doing this is:\indmod{using}

\begin{verbatim}
plot 'data.dat' using 3:5
\end{verbatim}

\noindent This example would plot the contents of the fifth column of the file
{\tt data.dat} on the vertical axis, against the contents of the third column
on the horizontal axis. As mentioned above, columns in \datafile s can be
separated using whitespace and/or commas.  Algebraic expressions may also be
used in place of column numbers, as in the example:

\begin{verbatim}
plot 'data.dat' using (3+$1+$2):(2+$3)
\end{verbatim}

\noindent In such expressions, column numbers are prefixed by dollar signs to
distinguish them from numerical constants. The example above would plot the sum
of the values in the first two columns of the \datafile, plus three, on the
horizontal axis, against two plus the value in the third column on the vertical
axis. The column numbers in such expressions can also be replaced by algebraic
expressions, and so {\tt \$2} can also be written as {\tt \$(2)} or {\tt
\$(1+1)}. In the following example, the \datapoint s are all placed on the
vertical line $x=3$ -- the brackets around the {\tt 3} distinguish it as a
numerical constant rather than a column number -- meanwhile their vertical
positions are drawn from the value of some column $n$ in the \datafile, where
the value of $n$ is itself read from the second column of the \datafile:

\begin{verbatim}
plot 'data.dat' using (3):$($2)
\end{verbatim}

It is also possible to plot data from only selected lines within a \datafile.
When Pyxplot reads a \datafile, it looks for any blank lines in the file. It
divides the \datafile\ up into {\it data blocks}, each being separated from the
next by a single blank line. The first data block is numbered~0, the next~1, and
so on.  \index{datafile format}

When two or more blank lines are found together, the \datafile\ is divided up
into {\it index blocks}. The first index block is numbered~0, the next~1, and
so on. Each index block may be made up of a series of data blocks. To clarify
this, a labelled example \datafile\ is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:sample_datafile}.

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|>{\columncolor{LightGrey}}p{2.2cm}>{\columncolor{LightGrey}}l|}
\hline
{\tt 0.0 \ 0.0} & Start of index 0, data block 0. \\
{\tt 1.0 \ 1.0} & \\
{\tt 2.0 \ 2.0} & \\
{\tt 3.0 \ 3.0} & \\
                & A single blank line marks the start of a new data block. \\
{\tt 0.0 \ 5.0} & Start of index 0, data block 1. \\
{\tt 1.0 \ 4.0} & \\
{\tt 2.0 \ 2.0} & \\
                & A double blank line marks the start of a new index. \\
                & ... \\
{\tt 0.0 \ 1.0} & Start of index 1, data block 0. \\
{\tt 1.0 \ 1.0} & \\
                & A single blank line marks the start of a new data block. \\
{\tt 0.0 \ 5.0} & Start of index 1, data block 1. \\
                & $<$etc$>$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{An example Pyxplot \datafile\ -- the \datafile\ is shown in the two left-hand columns, and commands are shown to the right.}
\label{fig:sample_datafile}
\end{figure}

By default, when a \datafile\ is plotted, all data blocks in all index blocks are
plotted. To plot only the data from one index block, the following syntax may
be used:

\begin{verbatim}
plot 'data.dat' index 1
\end{verbatim}

\noindent To achieve the default behaviour of plotting all index blocks, the
{\tt index} modifier should be followed by a negative number.\indmod{index}

It is also possible to specify which lines and/or data blocks to plot from
within each index. To do so, the \indmodt{every} modifier is used, which takes
up to six values, separated by colons:\label{sec:every}

\begin{verbatim}
plot 'data.dat' every a:b:c:d:e:f
\end{verbatim}

\noindent The values have the following meanings:

\begin{longtable}{p{1.0cm}p{10.5cm}}
$a$ & Plot data only from every $a\,$th line in \datafile. \\
$b$ & Plot only data from every $b\,$th block within each index block. \\
$c$ & Plot only from line $c$ onwards within each block. \\
$d$ & Plot only data from block $d$ onwards within each index block. \\
$e$ & Plot only up to the $e\,$th line within each block. \\
$f$ & Plot only up to the $f\,$th block within each index block. \\
\end{longtable}

\noindent Any or all of these values can be omitted, and so the following would
both be valid statements:

\begin{verbatim}
plot 'data.dat' index 1 every 2:3
plot 'data.dat' index 1 every ::3
\end{verbatim}

\noindent The first would plot only every other \datapoint\ from every third
data block; the second from the third line onwards within each data block.

\index{comment lines!in datafiles}
Comment lines may be included in \datafile s by prefixing them with a hash
character. Such lines are completely ignored by Pyxplot and do not count
towards the one or two blank lines required to separate blocks and index
blocks.  It is usually good practice to include comment lines at the top of
\datafile s to indicate their date and source. In
Section~\ref{sec:special_comments} we will see that Pyxplot can read metadata
from some comment lines which follow particular syntax.

\section{Plotting many \datafile s at once}

\index{globbing}\index{wildcards}\index{datafiles!globbing}

The wildcards {\tt *} and {\tt ?} may be used in filenames supplied to the
\indcmdt{plot} to plot many \datafile s at once. The following, for example,
would plot all \datafile s in the current directory with a {\tt .dat} suffix,
using the same plot options:

\begin{verbatim}
plot '*.dat' with linewidth 2
\end{verbatim}

\noindent In the graph's legend, full filenames are displayed, allowing the
\datafile s to be distinguished.

If a blank filename is supplied to the \indcmdt{plot}, the last used \datafile\
is used again, as in the example:

\begin{verbatim}
plot 'data.dat' using 1:2, '' using 2:3
\end{verbatim}

\noindent This can even be used with wildcards, as in the following example:

\begin{verbatim}
plot '*.dat' using 1:2, '' using 2:3
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Horizontally arranged \datafile s}
\label{sec:horizontal_datafiles}
\index{horizontal datafiles}\index{datafiles!horizontal}\index{using rows
modifier@{\tt using rows} modifier}\index{using columns modifier@{\tt using
columns} modifier}

Pyxplot also allows rows of data to be plotted against one another. To do so,
the keyword \indkeyt{rows} is placed after the {\tt using} modifier:

\begin{verbatim}
plot 'data.dat' index 1 using rows 1:2
\end{verbatim}

\noindent For completeness, the syntax {\tt using} \indkeyt{columns} is also
accepted, specifying that columns should be plotted against one another as
happens by default:

\begin{verbatim}
plot 'data.dat' index 1 using columns 1:2
\end{verbatim}

When plotting horizontally-arranged \datafile s, the meanings of the {\tt
index} and {\tt every} modifiers are altered slightly. The former continues to
refer to vertically-displaced blocks of data separated by two blank lines.
Blocks, as referenced in the {\tt every} modifier, likewise continue to refer
to vertically-displaced blocks of \datapoint s, separated by single blank
lines. The row numbers passed to the {\tt using} modifier are counted from the
top of the current block.

However, the line numbers specified in the \indmodt{every} modifier -- i.e.\
variables $a$, $c$ and $e$ in the system introduced in the previous section --
now refer to vertical column numbers. For example,

\begin{verbatim}
plot 'data.dat' using rows 1:2 every 2::3::9
\end{verbatim}

\noindent would plot the data in row~2 against that in row~1, using only the
values in every other column, between columns~3 and~9.

\subsection{Choosing which data to plot}
\label{sec:select_modifier}

The final modifier which the {\tt plot} command takes to allow the user to
specify which subset(s) of a \datafile\ should be plotted is \indmodt{select}.
This can be used to plot only those \datapoint s in a \datafile\ which specify
some given criterion, as in the following examples:

\begin{verbatim}
plot 'data.dat' select ($8>5)
plot sin(x) select (($1>0) and ($2>0))
\end{verbatim}

\noindent In the second example, two selection criteria are given, combined
with the logical {\tt and} operator. A full list of all of the operators
recognised by Pyxplot, including logical operators, was given in
Table~\ref{tab:operators_table}.

When plotting using \indpst{lines} to connect the \datapoint s (see
Section~\ref{sec:plotting_styles}), the default behaviour is for the lines not
to be broken if a set of \datapoint s are removed by the {\tt select} modifier.
However, this behaviour is sometimes undesirable.  To cause the plotted line to
break when points are removed the \indmodt{discontinuous}\ modifier is supplied
after the {\tt select} modifier, as in the example

\begin{verbatim}
plot sin(x) select ($2>0) discontinuous
\end{verbatim}

\noindent which plots a set of disconnected peaks from the sine function.

\section{The {\tt replot} command}
\label{sec:replot}

The \indcmdt{replot} may be used to add more datasets to an existing plot, or
to change its axis ranges. For example, having plotted one \datafile\ using the
command

\begin{verbatim}
plot 'datafile1.dat'
\end{verbatim}

\noindent another can be plotted on the same axes using the command

\begin{verbatim}
replot 'datafile2.dat' using 1:3
\end{verbatim}

\noindent or the ranges of the axes on the original plot can be changed using
the command

\begin{verbatim}
replot [0:1][0:1]
\end{verbatim}

\section{Directing where output goes}
\label{sec:directing_output}

By default, when Pyxplot is used interactively, all plots are displayed on the
screen. It is also possible to produce PostScript output, to be read into other
programs or embedded into \LaTeX\ documents, as well as a variety of other
graphical formats. The \indcmdt{set terminal}\footnote{Gnuplot users should
note that the syntax of the {\tt set terminal} command in Pyxplot is somewhat
different from that used by Gnuplot; see Section~\ref{sec:set_terminal}.} is
used to specify the output format that is required, and the \indcmdt{set
output} is used to specify the file to which output should be directed. For
example,

\begin{verbatim}
set terminal postscript
set output 'myplot.eps'
plot 'datafile.dat'
\end{verbatim}

\noindent would output a PostScript plot of data from the file {\tt datafile.dat} to the file
{\tt myplot.eps}.

The \indcmdt{set terminal} can also be used to configure various output options
within each supported file format.  For example, the following commands would
produce black-and-white or color output respectively:

\begin{verbatim}
set terminal monochrome
set terminal color
\end{verbatim}

\noindent The former is useful for preparing plots for black-and-white
publications, the latter for preparing plots for colorful presentations.

Both PostScript and Encapsulated PostScript can be produced. The former is
recommended for producing figures to embed into documents, the latter for plots
which are to be printed without further processing. The {\tt postscript}
terminal produces the latter; the {\tt eps} terminal should be used to produce
the former.  Similarly the {\tt pdf} terminal produces files in the Portable
Document Format (PDF)\index{pdf format} read by Adobe Acrobat\index{Adobe
Acrobat}:

\begin{verbatim}
set terminal postscript
set terminal eps
set terminal pdf
\end{verbatim}

It is also possible to produce plots in the gif, png and jpeg graphic formats,
as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
set terminal gif
set terminal png
set terminal jpg
\end{verbatim}

More than one of the above keywords can be combined on a single line, for
example:

\begin{verbatim}
set terminal postscript color
set terminal gif monochrome
\end{verbatim}

To return to the default state of displaying plots on screen, the {\tt x11}
terminal should be selected:

\begin{verbatim}
set terminal x11
\end{verbatim}

After changing terminals, the \indcmdt{refresh}\footnote{The effect of the {\tt
refresh} command is very similar to that of the {\tt replot} command with no
arguments. The latter simply repeats the last {\tt plot} command. We will see
in Chapter~\ref{ch:vector_graphics} that the {\tt refresh} command is to be
preferred in the current context because it is applicable to vector graphics as
well as to graphs.} is especially useful; it reproduces the last plot to have
been generated in the newly-selected graphical format.  For more details of the
\indcmdt{set terminal}, including how to produce gif and png images with
transparent backgrounds, see Chapter~\ref{ch:image_formats}.

\section{Setting the size of output}

The widths of plots may be set by means of two commands -- {\tt set
size}\indcmd{set size} and {\tt set width}\indcmd{set width}. Both are
equivalent, and should be followed by the desired width measured in
centimetres, for example:

\begin{verbatim}
set width 20
\end{verbatim}

The {\tt set size} command can also be used to set the aspect ratio of plots by
following it with the keyword {\tt ratio}\indcmd{set size ratio}. The number
which follows should be the desired ratio of height to width. The following,
for example, would produce plots three times as high as they are wide:

\begin{verbatim}
set size ratio 3.0
\end{verbatim}

\noindent The command {\tt set size noratio} returns to Pyxplot's default
aspect ratio of the golden ratio, i.e.\ $\left((1+\sqrt{5})/2\right)^{-1}$. The
special command {\tt set size square}\indcmd{set size square} sets the aspect
ratio to unity.

\section{Plotting styles}
\label{sec:plotting_styles}

By default, data from files are plotted with points and functions are plotted
with lines. However, either kinds of data can be plotted in a variety of ways.
To plot a function with points, for example, the following syntax is used:

\begin{verbatim}
plot sin(x) with points
\end{verbatim}

\noindent The number of points displayed (i.e.\ the number of samples of the
function) can be set as follows\indcmd{set samples}:

\begin{verbatim}
set samples 100
\end{verbatim}

\noindent Likewise, \datafile s can be plotted with a line connecting the
\datapoint s:

\begin{verbatim}
plot 'data.dat' with lines
\end{verbatim}

A variety of other styles are available. The \indpst{linespoints} plot style
combines both the \indpst{points} and \indpst{lines} styles, drawing lines
through points. Error bars can also be drawn as follows:\indps{yerrorbars}

\begin{verbatim}
plot 'data.dat' with yerrorbars
\end{verbatim}

\noindent In this case, three columns of data need to be specified: the $x$-
and $y$-coordinates of each \datapoint, plus the size of the vertical error bar
on that \datapoint. By default, the first three columns of the \datafile\ are
used, but as elsewhere (see Section~\ref{sec:plot_datafiles}), the {\tt using}
modifier can be used:

\begin{verbatim}
plot 'data.dat' using 2:3:7 with yerrorbars
\end{verbatim}

Other plot styles supported by Pyxplot are listed in
Section~\ref{sec:list_of_plotstyles}.  More details of the {\tt errorbars} plot
style can be found in Section~\ref{sec:errorbars}. Bar charts will be discussed
in Section~\ref{sec:barcharts}.

\label{sec:pointtype}
The modifiers \indpst{pointtype} and \indpst{linetype}, which can be
abbreviated to {\tt pt} and {\tt lt} respectively, can also be placed after the
{\tt with} modifier. Each should be followed by an integer.  The former
specifies what shape of points should be used to plot the dataset, and the
latter whether a line should be continuous, dotted, dash-dotted, etc.
Different integers correspond to different styles, and are listed in
Chapter~\ref{ch:linetypes_table}.

The default plotting style, used when none is specified to the {\tt plot}
command, can also be changed.  For example:\indcmd{set style data}

\begin{verbatim}
set style data lines
\end{verbatim}

\noindent would change the default style used for plotting data from files to
{\tt lines}. Similarly, the \indcmdt{set style function} changes the default
style used when functions are plotted.

\section{Setting axis ranges}
\label{sec:plot_ranges}

By default, Pyxplot automatically scales axes to some sensible range which
contains all of the plotted data. However, it is possible for the user to
override this and set his own range.\index{axes!setting ranges} This can be
done directly from the plot command, by following the word {\tt plot} with the
syntax {\tt [minimum:maximum]}.\footnote{An alternative valid syntax is to
replace the colon with the word {\tt to}: {\tt [minimum to maximum]}.} The
first specified range applies to the {\tt x}-axis, and the second to the {\tt
y}-axis.\footnote{As will be discussed in Section~\ref{sec:multiple_axes}, if
further ranges are specified, they apply to the {\tt x2}-axis, then the {\tt
y2}-axis, and so forth.} In the following example, the first three cylindrical
Bessel functions are plotted in the range $0<x<10$:

\begin{verbatim}
plot [0:10][-0.5:1] besselJ(0,x), besselJ(1,x), besselJ(2,x)
\end{verbatim}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=8cm]{examples/eps/ex_intro_bessel}
\end{center}

\noindent Any of the values can be omitted, as in the following plot of
three Legendre polynomials:

\begin{verbatim}
set key xcentre
plot [-1:1][:] legendreP(2,x), legendreP(4,x), legendreP(6,x)
\end{verbatim}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=8cm]{examples/eps/ex_intro_legendre}
\end{center}

\noindent Here, we have used the {\tt set key} command to specify that the
plot's legend should be horizontally aligned in the centre of the plot, to
complement the symmetry of the Legendre polynomials. This command will be
described more fully in Section~\ref{sec:legends}.

Alternatively, ranges can be set before the {\tt plot} statement, using the
\indcmdt{set xrange}, as in the examples:

\begin{verbatim}
set xrange [-2:2]
set yrange [a:b]
\end{verbatim}

If an asterisk is supplied in place of either of the limits in this command, then
any limit which had previously been set is switched off, and the axis returns to
its default autoscaling behaviour:

\begin{verbatim}
set xrange [-2:*]
\end{verbatim}

\noindent A similar effect may be obtained using the \indcmdt{set autoscale},
which takes a list of the axes to which it is to apply. Both the upper and
lower limits of these axes are set to scale automatically. If no list is
supplied, then the command is applied to all axes.

\begin{verbatim}
set autoscale x y
set autoscale
\end{verbatim}

The range supplied to the {\tt set xrange} can be followed by the word {\tt
reverse} to indicate that the axis should run from right-to-left, or from
top-to-bottom. In practice, this is of limited use when an explicit range is
specified, as the following two commands are equivalent:

\begin{verbatim}
set xrange [-2:2] reverse
set xrange [2:-2] noreverse
\end{verbatim}

\noindent However, this is useful when axes are set to autoscale:

\begin{verbatim}
set xrange [*:*] reverse
\end{verbatim}

Axes can be set to have logarithmic scales by using the \indcmdt{set logscale},
which also takes a list of axes to which it should apply. Its converse is
\indcmdts{set nologscale}:

\begin{verbatim}
set logscale
set nologscale y x x2
\end{verbatim}

Further discussion of the configuration of axes can be found in
Section~\ref{sec:multiple_axes}.

\example{ex:axislab}{A diagram of the trajectories of projectiles fired with different initial velocities}{
In this example we produce a diagram of the trajectories of projectiles fired
by a cannon at the origin with different initial velocities $v$ and different
angles of inclination $\theta$. According to the equations of motion under
constant acceleration, the distance of such a projectile from the origin after
time $t$ is given by
\begin{eqnarray*}
x(t) & = & vt\cos\,\theta \\
h(t) & = & vt\sin\,\theta + \nicefrac{1}{2}gt^2 \\
\end{eqnarray*}
where $x(t)$ is the horizontal displacement of the projectile and $h(t)$ the
vertical displacement. Eliminating $t$ from these equation gives the expression
\begin{displaymath}
h(x) = x\tan\,\theta - \frac{gx^2}{2v^2\cos^2\,\theta}.
\end{displaymath}
\nlscf
In the script below, we plot this function for five different values of $v$ and
$\theta$.

\section{Interactive help}

In addition to this {\it Users' Guide}, Pyxplot also has a \indcmdt{help},
which provides a hierarchical source of information. Typing {\tt help} alone
gives a brief introduction to the help system, as well as a list of topics on
which help is available. To display help on any given topic, type {\tt help}
followed by the name of the topic. For example,

\begin{verbatim}
help datafile
\end{verbatim}

\noindent provides information on the format in which Pyxplot expects to read
\datafile s and

\begin{verbatim}
help plot
\end{verbatim}

\noindent provides information on the {\tt plot} command.  Some topics have
sub-topics, which are listed at the end of each page. To view them, add further
words to the end of your help request -- an example might be

\begin{verbatim}
help set title
\end{verbatim}
