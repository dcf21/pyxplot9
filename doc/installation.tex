\chapter{Installation}

\label{ch:installation}

In this chapter we describe in outline how to install PyXPlot on a range of
UNIX-like operating systems.

\section{System Requirements}

PyXPlot works on most UNIX-like operating systems. We have tested it under
Linux, Solaris\index{Solaris} and MacOS~X\index{MacOS X}, and believe that it
should work on other similar POSIX systems. We regret that it is not available
for Microsoft Windows, and have no plans for porting it at this time. It
requires that the following software packages (not included) be
installed:\index{system requirements}

\vspace{0.5cm}
\begin{itemize}
\item fftw (version 2 or, preferably, 3+) \index{fftw}
\item gcc and make\index{gcc}\index{make}
\item Ghostscript \index{Ghostscript}
\item The Gnu Scientific Library (version 1.10+) \index{gsl}
\item ImageMagick \index{ImageMagick}
\item \LaTeX\ (version $2\epsilon$; a full installation is likely to be required in distributions which offer a choice) \index{latex}
\item libpng (version 1.2+) \index{libpng}
\item libxml2 (version 2.6+) \index{libxml}
\item zlib \index{zlib}
\end{itemize}
\vspace{0.5cm}

\noindent It is also very strongly recommended that the following software
packages be installed. In each case, PyXPlot tests for the availability of
these packages upon installation, and issues a warning if the package is not
found. Installation can proceed, but some of PyXPlot's features will be
disabled. Once they have been added to the system, PyXPlot should be
reinstalled to take advantage of their presence.

\vspace{0.5cm}
\begin{itemize}
\item cfitsio -- required for PyXPlot to be able to plot \datafile s in FITS format.
\item Ghostview \index{Ghostview} (or {\tt ggv}) -- required for PyXPlot to be able to display plots live on the screen; PyXPlot remains able to generate image files on disk without it. Alternatively, the \indcmdt{set viewer} within PyXPlot allows a different PostScript viewer to be used.
\item gunzip \index{gunzip} -- required for PyXPlot to be able to plot compressed \datafile s in {\tt .gz} format.
\item The Gnu Readline Library (version 5+) \index{readline} -- required for PyXPlot to be able to provide tab completion and command histories in PyXPlot's interactive command-line interface.
\item libkpathsea \index{libkpathsea} -- required to efficiently find the fonts used by \LaTeX.
\item wget \index{wget} -- required for PyXPlot to be able to plot \datafile s directly from the Internet.
\end{itemize}
\vspace{0.5cm}

Debian and Ubuntu users can find the above software in the following packages:
\index{Debian Linux}\index{Ubuntu Linux}\index{installation!under Debian}\index{installation!under Ubuntu}

\vspace{2mm}
\noindent {\tt fftw3-dev}, {\tt gcc}, {\tt gs}, {\tt gv}, {\tt imagemagick}, {\tt libc6-dev}, {\tt libcfitsio3-dev},\newline
\noindent {\tt libgsl0-dev}, {\tt libkpathsea-dev}, {\tt libpng12-dev}, {\tt libreadline5-dev},\newline
\noindent {\tt libxml2-dev}, {\tt make}, {\tt texlive-latex-extra}, {\tt texlive-latex-recommended},\newline
\noindent {\tt texlive-fonts-recommended}, {\tt texlive-fonts-extra}, {\tt wget}, {\tt zlib1g-dev}.
\vspace{2mm}

\noindent These packages may be installed from a command prompt by typing, all on one line:

\begin{verbatim}
sudo apt-get install fftw3-dev gcc gs gv imagemagick libc6-dev
       libcfitsio3-dev libgsl0-dev libkpathsea-dev libpng12-dev
       libreadline5-dev libxml2-dev make texlive-latex-extra
       texlive-latex-recommended texlive-fonts-extra
       texlive-fonts-recommended wget zlib1g-dev
\end{verbatim}

Users of MacOS~X can find the above software in the following MacPorts packages:
\index{MacOS X}\index{MacPorts}

\vspace{2mm}
\noindent {\tt cfitsio}, {\tt fftw-3}, {\tt ghostscript}, {\tt gsl-devel}, {\tt gv}, {\tt ImageMagick}, {\tt libpng},\newline
\noindent {\tt libxml2}, {\tt readline-5}, {\tt texlive}, {\tt wget}, {\tt zlib}.
\vspace{2mm}

It may then be necessary to run the command
\begin{verbatim}
export C_INCLUDE_PATH=/opt/local/include
\end{verbatim}
before running the {\tt configure} script below.

\section{Installation}
\index{installation}

\subsection{Installation within Linux Distributions}

PyXPlot is available as a user-installable package within some Linux
distributions. At the time of writing, Gentoo\index{Gentoo
Linux}\index{installation!under Gentoo}\footnote{See
\url{http://gentoo-portage.com/sci-visualization/pyxplot}}, Ubuntu\index{Ubuntu
Linux}\index{installation!under Ubuntu} and Debian provide packages containing
PyXPlot~0.7.x. It should be noted that this manual describes PyXPlot~0.8.x,
which is a very substantial upgrade to version~0.7.x. Many of the features
described in this manual are not available in previous versions.

Under Debian and Ubuntu Linux, version~0.8.5 may be manually installed by
downloading the appropriate {\tt .deb} file for your distribution from the
PyXPlot website and typing

\begin{verbatim}
dpkg -i <filename>.deb
\end{verbatim}

Users of other distributions should use the {\tt .tar.gz} archives available
from the PyXPlot website as described below.

\subsection{Installation as User}

The following steps describe the installation of PyXPlot from a {\tt .tar.gz}
archive by a user without superuser (i.e.\ root) access to his machine. The
required archive can be downloaded from the PyXPlot website. It is assumed that
the packages listed above have already been installed; if they are not, you
will need to contact your system administrator.\index{installation!user-level}

\begin{itemize}
\item Unpack the distributed .tar.gz:

\begin{verbatim}
tar xvfz pyxplot_0.8.5.tar.gz
cd pyxplot-0.8.5
\end{verbatim}

\item Run the installation script:

\begin{verbatim}
./configure
make
\end{verbatim}

\item Finally, start PyXPlot:

\begin{verbatim}
./bin/pyxplot
\end{verbatim}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{System-wide Installation}

Having completed the steps described above, PyXPlot may be installed
system-wide by a superuser with the following additional
step:\index{installation!system-wide}

\begin{verbatim}
make install
\end{verbatim}

By default, the PyXPlot executable installs to {\tt /usr/local/bin/pyxplot}.
If desired, this installation path may be modified in the file {\tt
Makefile.skel}, by changing the variable {\tt USRDIR} in the first line to an
alternative desired installation location.

PyXPlot may now be started by any system user, simply by typing

\begin{verbatim}
pyxplot
\end{verbatim}
