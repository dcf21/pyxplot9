\chapter{Programming and flow control}

In this chapter we describe the facilities which PyXPlot has for automating
repetitive tasks. We begin by introducing string variables, which can be useful
for auto-generating titles and labels for graphs which are being produced in
batch jobs. We then discuss the loop constructs which make it possible to run
such batch jobs, producing similar plots of many different \datafile s or
performing calculations in an iterative fashion. Finally, we turn to PyXPlot's
interaction with the shell and filing system in which it operates, introducing
a simple framework for automatically re-executing PyXPlot scripts whenever they
change, allowing plots to be automatically regenerated whenever the scripts
used to produce them are modified.

\section{String variables}
\label{sec:stringvars}
\index{variables!string}

Variables may hold not only numerical quantities, but also strings of text.  In
the course of this chapter, we will see several examples where string variables
are used either to generate automatic labels for graphs plotted in batch jobs,
or to read strings of text from columns of \datafile s. String variables can be
assigned in a analogous manner to numeric variables, and can subsequently be
used anywhere where a quoted string could have been used, as in the example:
\begin{verbatim}
plotname = "Insert title here"
set title plotname
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{The string substitution operator}
\label{sec:stringsubop}

Most string manipulations are performed using the string substitution operator,
{\tt \%}\index{\% operator@{\tt \%} operator}. This operator should be
preceded by a format string, such as {\tt x=\%f}, in which tokens such as {\tt
\%f} mark places where numbers and strings should be substituted. The
substitution operator is followed by a bracketed list of the quantities which
should be substituted in place of these tokens in the format string. This
behaviour is similar to that of the Python programming language's \%
operator\footnote{Unlike in Python, the brackets are obligatory; {\tt '\%d'\%2}
is {\it not} valid in PyXPlot, and should be written as {\tt '\%d'\%(2)}.} and
of the {\tt printf} statement in C.  For example, to concatenate the two
strings contained in the variables {\tt a} and {\tt b} into a single string
variable {\tt c}, one would issue the command:\index{string
operators!concatenation}
\begin{verbatim}
c = "%s%s"%(a,b)
\end{verbatim}

One application of this operator might be to label plots with the title of the
\datafile\ being plotted, as in the following example:
\begin{verbatim}
filename="data_file.dat"
title="A plot of the data in {\tt %s}."%(filename)
set title title
plot filename
\end{verbatim}

The syntax of the substitution tokens placed in the format string is similar to
that used by many other languages and is as follows. All substitution tokens
begin with a {\tt \%} character, after which there may be placed, in order:

\begin{enumerate}
\item An optional minus sign, to specify that the substituted item should be left-justified.
\item An optional integer specifying the minimum character width of the substituted item, or a {\tt *} (see below).
\item An optional decimal point/period ({\tt .}) separator.
\item An optional integer, or a {\tt *} (see below), specifying either (a) the maximum number of characters to be printed from a string, or (b) the number of decimal places of a floating-point number to be displayed, or (c) the minimum number of digits of an integer to be displayed, padded to the left with zeros.
\item A conversion character.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent The conversion character is a single character which specifies what
kind of substitution should take place. Its possible values are listed in
Table~\ref{tab:conversion_chars}. Note that where numerical quantities with
physical units are provided, the physical units are not displayed unless the
{\tt \%s} token is used. Although it is not an error to pass a quantity with
physical units to, for example, the {\tt \%f} substitution token, it is good
practice to divide the quantity by a suitable unit first to make it
dimensionless, to be certain of the unit in which it will be displayed.

\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|>{\columncolor{LightGrey}}l>{\columncolor{LightGrey}}p{9cm}|}
\hline
{\bf Character} & {\bf Substitutes} \\
\hline
{\tt d}, {\tt i}   & An integer value. \\
{\tt e}, {\tt E}   & A floating-point value in scientific notation using either the character {\tt e} or {\tt E} to indicate exponentiation. \\
{\tt f}            & A floating-point value without the use of scientific notation. \\
{\tt g}, {\tt G}   & A floating-point value, either using scientific notation, if the exponent is greater than the precision or less than $-4$, otherwise without the use of scientific notation. \\
{\tt o}            & An integer value in octal (base~8). \\
{\tt s}, {\tt S}, {\tt c} & A string, if a string is provided, or a numerical quantity, with units, if such is provided. \\
{\tt x}, {\tt X}   & An integer value in hexadecimal (base~16). \\
{\tt \%}           & A literal {\tt \%} sign. \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{The conversion characters recognised by the string substitution operator, {\tt \%}.}
\label{tab:conversion_chars}
\end{table}

Where the character {\tt *} is specified for either the character width or the
precision of the substitution token, an integer is read from the list of items
to be substituted, as happens in C's {\tt printf} command:

\vspace{3mm}
\noindent{\tt pyxplot> {\bf print "\%.*f"\%(3,pi)}}\newline
\noindent{\tt 3.142}\newline
\noindent{\tt pyxplot> {\bf print "\%.*f"\%(6,pi)}}\newline
\noindent{\tt 3.141593}
\vspace{3mm}

\subsection{Regular expressions}

String variables can be modified using the search-and-replace string
operator\index{string operators!search and replace}\footnote{Programmers with
experience of {\tt perl} will recognise this syntax.}, =$\sim$\index{=$\sim$
operator}, which takes a regular expression with a syntax similar to that
expected by the shell command {\tt sed}\index{sed shell command@{\tt sed} shell
command} and applies it to the relevant string variable.\footnote{Regular
expression syntax is a massive subject, and is beyond the scope of this manual.
The official GNU documentation for the {\tt sed} command is heavy reading, but
there are many more accessible tutorials on the web.}\index{regular
expressions} In the following example, the first instance of the letter {\tt s} in
the string variable {\tt twister} is replaced with the letters {\tt th}:

\vspace{3mm}
\noindent{\tt pyxplot> {\bf twister="seven silver soda syphons"}}\newline
\noindent{\tt pyxplot> {\bf twister =$\sim$ s/s/th/}}\newline
\noindent{\tt pyxplot> {\bf print twister}}\newline
\noindent{\tt theven silver soda syphons}
\vspace{3mm}

Note that only the {\tt s} (substitute) command of {\tt sed} is implemented in
PyXPlot. Any character can be used in place of the {\tt /} characters in the
above example, for example:

\begin{verbatim}
twister =~ s's'th'
\end{verbatim}

\noindent Flags can be passed, as in {\tt sed} or {\tt perl}, to modify the
precise behaviour of the regular expression. In the following example the {\tt
g} flag is used to perform a global search-and-replace of all instances of the
letter {\tt s} with the letters {\tt th}:

\vspace{3mm}
\noindent{\tt pyxplot> {\bf twister="seven silver soda syphons"}}\newline
\noindent{\tt pyxplot> {\bf twister =$\sim$ s/s/th/g}}\newline
\noindent{\tt pyxplot> {\bf print twister}}\newline
\noindent{\tt theven thilver thoda thyphonth}
\vspace{3mm}

\noindent Table~\ref{tab:re_flags} lists all of the regular expression flags
recognised by the =$\sim$ operator.

\begin{table}
{\footnotesize
\begin{tabular}{|>{\columncolor{LightGrey}}p{5mm}>{\columncolor{LightGrey}}p{10.5cm}|}
\hline
{\tt g} & Replace {\it all} matches of the pattern; by default, only the first match is replaced. \\
{\tt i} & Perform case-insensitive matching, such that expressions like {\tt [A-Z]} will match lowercase letters, too. \\
{\tt l} & Make {\tt $\backslash$w}, {\tt $\backslash$W}, {\tt $\backslash$b}, {\tt $\backslash$B}, {\tt $\backslash$s} and {\tt $\backslash$S} dependent on the current locale. \\
{\tt m} & When specified, the pattern character {\tt \^{}} matches the beginning of the string and the beginning of each line immediately following each newline. The pattern character {\tt \$} matches at the end of the string and the end of each line immediately preceding each newline. By default, {\tt \^{}} matches only the beginning of the string, and {\tt \$} only the end of the string and immediately before the newline, if present, at the end of the string. \\
{\tt s} & Make the {\tt .} special character match any character at all, including a newline; without this flag, {\tt .} will match anything except a newline. \\
{\tt u} & Make {\tt $\backslash$w}, {\tt $\backslash$W}, {\tt $\backslash$b}, {\tt $\backslash$B}, {\tt $\backslash$s} and {\tt $\backslash$S} dependent on the Unicode character properties database. \\
{\tt x} & This flag allows the user to write regular expressions that look nicer. Whitespace within the pattern is ignored, except when in a character class or preceded by an un-escaped backslash. When a line contains a {\tt \#}, neither in a character class nor preceded by an un-escaped backslash, all characters from the left-most such {\tt \#} through to the end of the line are ignored. \\
\hline
\end{tabular}}
\caption{A list of the flags accepted by the =$\sim$ operator. Most are rarely used, but the {\tt g} flag is very useful.}
\label{tab:re_flags}
\end{table}

\subsection{String manipulation functions}

The following functions are provided for performing simple manipulations upon
strings:

\noindent
\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt strcmp(s1,s2)}\indfun{strcmp($s1,s2$)} returns zero if the strings {\tt s1} and {\tt s2} are the same, one if {\tt s1} should be placed after {\tt s2} in alphabetical sequence, minus one if {\tt s1} should be placed before {\tt s2} in alphabetical sequence.
\item {\tt strlen(s)}\indfun{strlen($s$)} returns the integer length of the string variable {\tt s}. An error is returned if {\tt s} is not a string variable.
\item {\tt strlower(s)}\indfun{strlower($s$)} returns a version of the string {\tt s} in which all uppercase alphabetical characters are converted to lowercase characters.
\item {\tt strrange(s,i,j)}\indfun{strrange($s,i,j$)} returns a slice of the string $s$, containing only the $i$th through until the $j$th characters of the string. If either $i$ or $j$ are negative, they are counted from the end of the string; for example, $-1$ refers to the last character of the string.
\item {\tt strupper(s)}\indfun{strupper($s$)} returns a version of the string {\tt s} in which all lowercase alphabetical characters are converted to uppercase characters.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
The following simple examples demonstrate the use of these functions:

\vspace{3mm}
\noindent{\tt pyxplot> {\bf x="It was the best of times, it was the worst of times"}}\newline
\noindent{\tt pyxplot> {\bf print strlen(x)}}\newline
\noindent{\tt 51}\newline
\noindent{\tt pyxplot> {\bf print strrange(x,0,24)}}\newline
\noindent{\tt It was the best of times}\newline
\noindent{\tt pyxplot> {\bf print strrange(x,-25,0)}}\newline
\noindent{\tt it was the worst of times}\newline
\noindent{\tt pyxplot> {\bf print strupper(x)}}\newline
\noindent{\tt IT WAS THE BEST OF TIMES, IT WAS THE WORST OF TIMES}
\vspace{3mm}

\section{Conditionals}

The {\tt if} statement\indcmd{if} can be used to conditionally execute a series
of commands only when a certain criterion is satisfied. In its simplest form,
its syntax is

\begin{verbatim}
if <expression> {
  ....
 }
\end{verbatim}

\noindent where the expression can take the form of, for example, {\tt x<0} or
{\tt y==1}. Note that the operator {\tt ==} is used to test the equality of two
algebraic expressions; the operator {\tt =} is only used to assign values to
variables and functions. A full list of the operators available can be found in
Table~\ref{tab:operators_table}. As in many other programming languages,
algebraic expressions are deemed to be true if they evaluate to any non-zero
value, and false if they exactly equal zero. Thus, the following two examples
are entirely legal syntax, and the first {\tt print} statement will execute,
but the second will not:

\begin{verbatim}
if 2*3 {
  print "2*3 is True"
 }

if 2-2 {
  print "2-2 is False"
 }
\end{verbatim}

\noindent The variables {\tt True} and {\tt False} are predefined constants,
which evaluate to~1 and~0 respectively, making the following syntax legal:

\begin{verbatim}
if False {
  print "Never gets here"
 }
\end{verbatim}

As in C, the block of commands which are to be conditionally executed is
enclosed in braces (i.e.\ {\tt \{~\}}).  There are, however, some rules about
the arrangement of whitespace.  The block of commands must begin on a new line
after the {\tt if} statement. The closing brace must be on a line by itself at
the end of the block. Alternatively, semi-colons may, as always, be used in the
place of new lines. The opening brace may be placed either on the same line as
the {\tt if} statement, or on the following line:

\begin{verbatim}
if (x==0)
 {
  print "x is zero"
 }

if (x==0) { ; print "x is zero" ; }
\end{verbatim}

After such an {\tt if} clause, it is possible to string together further
conditions in {\tt else if} clauses, perhaps with a final {\tt else} clause, as
in the example:

\begin{verbatim}
if (x==0)
 {
  print "x is zero"
 } else if (x>0) {
  print "x is positive"
 } else {
  print "x is negative"
 }
\end{verbatim}

Here, as previously, the first script block is executed if the first
conditional, {\tt x==0}, is true. If this script block is not executed, the
second conditional, {\tt x>0}, is then tested. If this is true, then the second
script block is executed.  The final script block, following the {\tt else}, is
executed if none of the preceding conditionals have been true. Any number of
{\tt else if} statements can be chained one after another, and a final {\tt
else} statement can always be optionally supplied. The {\tt else} and {\tt else
if} statements must always be placed on the same line as the closing brace of
the preceding script block.

The precise way in which a string of {\tt else if} statements are arranged in a
PyXPlot script is a matter of taste: the following is a more compact but
equivalent version of the example given above:

\begin{verbatim}
if      (x==0) { ; print "x is zero"     ; } \
else if (x> 0) { ; print "x is positive" ; } \
else           { ; print "x is negative" ; }
\end{verbatim}

\section{For loops}

For loops may be used to execute a series of commands multiple times. PyXPlot's
\indcmdt{for} has the syntax:

\begin{verbatim}
for <variable> = <start> to <end> {step <step>} {loopname <name>}
 {
  ....
 }
\end{verbatim}

\noindent The first time that the script block is executed, the variable named
at the start of the {\tt for} statement has the value given for {\tt start}.
Upon each iteration of the loop, this is incremented by amount {\tt step}. The
loop finishes when the value exceeds {\tt end}. If {\tt step} is negative, then
{\tt end} is required to be less than or equal to {\tt start}. A step size of
zero is considered to be an error.  The iterator variable can have any physical
dimensions, so long as {\tt start}, {\tt end} and {\tt step} all have the same
dimensions, but the iterator variable must always be a real number. If no step
size is given then a step size of unity is assumed.  As an example, the
following script would print the numbers 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8:

\begin{verbatim}
for x = 0 to 10 step 2
 {
  print x
 }
\end{verbatim}

\noindent The same rules concerning the placement of brace characters apply to
the \indcmdt{for} as to the {\tt if} command.

The optional {\tt loopname} which can be specified in the {\tt for} statement
is used in conjunction with the {\tt break} and {\tt continue} statements which
will be introduced in Section~\ref{sec:breakcontinue}.

\section{Foreach loops}
\indcmd{foreach}
\index{wildcards}

Foreach loops may be used to run a script block once for each item in a list.
The list may either take the form of an explicit bracketed comma-separated list
of items, or the form of one or more filename wildcards, as in the following
examples:

\begin{verbatim}
foreach x in (-1,pi,10)
 {
  print x
 }

foreach x in "*.dat"
 {
  print x
 }
\end{verbatim}

The first of these loops would iterate three times, with the variable {\tt x}
holding the values $-1$, $\pi$ and $10$ in turn. The second of these loops
would search for any \datafile s in the user's current directory with filenames
ending in {\tt .dat} and iterate for each of them. As previously, the wildcard
character {\tt *} matches any string of characters, and the character {\tt ?}
matches any single character. Thus, {\tt foo?.dat} would match {\tt foo1.dat}
and {fooX.dat}, but not {\tt foo.dat} or {\tt foo10.dat}. The effect of the
{\tt print} statement in this particular example would be rather similar to
typing:

\begin{verbatim}
!ls *.dat
\end{verbatim}

The quotes around each supplied search string are compulsory if any of the
characters in the search string are alphanumeric, but optional otherwise. Since
both of the wildcard characters {\tt *} and {\tt ?} are non-alphanumeric, the
quotes are compulsory in most useful cases.  An error is returned if there are
no files in the present directory which match the supplied wildcard. The
following example would produce plots of all of the \datafile s in the current
directory with filenames {\tt foo\_*.dat} or {\tt bar\_*.dat} as {\tt eps}
files with matching filenames:

\begin{verbatim}
set terminal eps
foreach x in "foo_*.dat" "bar_*.dat"
 {
  outfilename =  x
  outfilename =~ s/dat/eps/
  set output outfilename
  plot x using 1:2
 }
\end{verbatim}

\section{Foreach datum loops}
\label{sec:foreach_datum}

Foreach datum loops are similar to foreach loops in that they run a script
block once for each item in a list.  In this case, however, the list in
question is the list of \datapoint s in a file. The syntax of the
\indcmdt{foreach datum} is similar to that of the commands met in the previous
chapter for acting upon \datafile s: the standard modifiers {\tt every}, {\tt
index}, {\tt select} and {\tt using} can be used to select which columns of the
\datafile, and which subset of the datapoints, should be used:

\begin{verbatim}
foreach datum i,j,name in "data.dat" using 1:2:"%s"%($3)
 {
  ...
 }
\end{verbatim}

The \indcmdt{foreach datum} is followed by a comma-separated list of the
variable(s) which are to be read from the \datafile\ on each iteration of the
loop. The {\tt using} modifier specifies the columns or rows of data which are
to be used to set the values of each variable. In this example, the third
variable, {\tt name}, is set using a quoted string, indicating that it will be
set to equal whatever string of text is found in the third column of the
\datafile.

\example{ex:meansd}{Calculating the mean and standard deviation of data}{
The following PyXPlot script calculates the mean and standard deviation of a
set of \datapoint s using the \indcmdt{foreach datum}:
\nlscf
\noindent{\tt N\_data = 0}\newline
\noindent{\tt sum\_x  = 0}\newline
\noindent{\tt sum\_x2 = 0}\newline
\\
\noindent{\tt foreach datum x in '--'}\newline
\noindent{\tt \phantom{x}\{}\newline
\noindent{\tt \phantom{xx}N\_data = N\_data + 1}\newline
\noindent{\tt \phantom{xx}sum\_x  = sum\_x  + x}\newline
\noindent{\tt \phantom{xx}sum\_x2 = sum\_x2 + x**2}\newline
\noindent{\tt \phantom{x}\}}\newline
\noindent{\tt 1.3}\newline
\noindent{\tt 1.2}\newline
\noindent{\tt 1.5}\newline
\noindent{\tt 1.1}\newline
\noindent{\tt 1.3}\newline
\noindent{\tt END}\newline
\\
\noindent{\tt mean = sum\_x / N\_data}\newline
\noindent{\tt SD   = sqrt(sum\_x2 / N\_data - mean**2)}\newline
\\
\noindent{\tt print "Mean = \%s"\%(mean)}\newline
\noindent{\tt print "SD   = \%s"\%(SD)}
\nlscf
\noindent For the data supplied, a mean of $1.28$ and a standard deviation of
$0.133$ are returned.
}

\section{While and do loops}

The \indcmdt{while} may be used to continue running a script block until some
stopping criterion is met. Two types of while loop are supported:

\begin{verbatim}
while <criterion> {loopname <name>}
 {
  ....
 }

do {loopname <name>}
 {
  ....
 } while <criterion>
\end{verbatim}
\indcmd{do}

In the former case, the enclosed script block is executed repeatedly, and the
algebraic expression supplied to the \indcmdt{while} is tested immediately
before each repetition. If it tests false, then the loop finishes.  The latter
case is very similar, except that the supplied algebraic expression is tested
immediately {\it after} each repetition. Thus, the former example may never
actually execute the supplied script block if the looping criterion tests false
upon the first iteration, but the latter example is always guaranteed to run
its script block at least once.

The following example would continue looping indefinitely until stopped by the
user, since the value {\tt 1} is considered to be true:

\begin{verbatim}
while (1)
 {
  print "Hello, world!"
 }
\end{verbatim}

\section{The {\tt break} and {\tt continue} statements}
\label{sec:breakcontinue}
\indcmd{break}
\indcmd{continue}

The {\tt break} and {\tt continue} statements may be placed within loop
structures to interrupt their iteration. The {\tt break} statement terminates
execution of the smallest loop currently being executed, and PyXPlot resumes
execution at the next statement after the closing brace which marks the end of
that loop structure. The {\tt continue} statement terminates execution of the
{\it current iteration} of the smallest loop currently being executed, and
execution proceeds with the next iteration of that loop, as demonstrated by the
following pair of examples:

\vspace{3mm}
\noindent{\tt pyxplot>~{\bf for i=0 to 4 \{}}\newline
\noindent{\tt for... >~~{\bf if (i==2) \{ ; break; \}}}\newline
\noindent{\tt for... >~~{\bf print i}}\newline
\noindent{\tt for... >~{\bf \}}}\newline
\noindent{\tt 0}\newline
\noindent{\tt 1}\newline
\noindent{\tt pyxplot>~{\bf for i=0 to 4 \{}}\newline
\noindent{\tt for... >~~{\bf if (i==2) \{ ; continue ; \}}}\newline
\noindent{\tt for... >~~{\bf print i}}\newline
\noindent{\tt for... >~{\bf \}}}\newline
\noindent{\tt 0}\newline
\noindent{\tt 1}\newline
\noindent{\tt 3}
\vspace{3mm}

Note that if several loops are nested, the {\tt break} and {\tt continue}
statements only act upon the innermost loop. If either statement is encountered
outside of a loop structure, an error results. Optionally, the {\tt for}, {\tt
foreach}, {\tt do} and {\tt while} commands may be supplied with a name for the
loop, prefixed by the word {\tt loopname}, as in the examples:

\begin{verbatim}
for i=0 to 4 loopname iloop
...
foreach i in "*.dat" loopname DatafileLoop
...
\end{verbatim}

\noindent When loops are given such names, the {\tt break} and {\tt continue}
statements may be followed by the name of the loop to be broken out of,
allowing the user to act upon loops other than the innermost one.

\section{Conditional functions}
\indfun{conditionalN($a,b,c$)}
\indfun{conditionalS($a,b,c$)}

The pre-defined functions {\tt conditionalN()} and {\tt conditionalS()} provide
a compact means of inserting conditional expressions into numerical and string
expressions respectively.  Each takes three arguments, the first of which is a
truth criterion to be tested. If the criterion is true, then the function's
second argument is returned as its output. Otherwise, the function's third
argument is returned. This is similar to the behaviour of C's ternary {\tt ?:}
operator.  The {\tt conditionalN()} function should be passed two numerical
expressions to select between, whilst the {\tt conditionalS()} function should
be passed two string expressions, as the following examples demonstrate:

\vspace{2mm}
{\footnotesize
\noindent{\tt pyxplot> {\bf f(x) = conditionalN(x$>$0,x,0)}}\newline
\noindent{\tt pyxplot> {\bf print "\%s \%s \%s \%s \%s"\%(f(-2),f(-1),f(0),f(1),f(2))}}\newline
\noindent{\tt 0 0 0 1 2}\newline
\noindent{\tt pyxplot> {\bf x = 2}}\newline
\noindent{\tt pyxplot> {\bf print "x is \%s"\%(conditionalS(x$>$0,"positive","negative"))}}\newline
\noindent{\tt x is positive}\newline
}

\section{Subroutines}
\indcmd{subroutine}
\label{sec:subroutines}

Subroutines are similar to mathematical functions (see
Section~\ref{sec:functions}), and once defined, can be used anywhere in
algebraic expressions, just as functions can be.  However, instead of being
defined by a single algebraic expression, whenever a subroutine is evaluated, a
block of PyXPlot commands of arbitrary length is executed. This gives much
greater flexibility for implementing complex algorithms. Subroutines are
defined using the following syntax:
\begin{verbatim}
subroutine <name>(<variable1>,...)
 {
  ...
  return <value>
 }
\end{verbatim}
Where {\tt name} is the name of the subroutine, {\tt variable1} is an argument
taken by the subroutine, and the value passed to the {\tt return} statement is
the value returned to the caller. Once the {\tt return} statement is reached,
execution of the subroutine is terminated. The following two examples would
produce entirely equivalent results:
\begin{verbatim}
f(x,y) = x*sin(y)

subroutine f(x,y)
 {
  return x*sin(y)
 }
\end{verbatim}
In either case, the function/subroutine could be evaluated by typing:
\begin{verbatim}
print f(1,pi/2)
\end{verbatim}
If a subroutine ends without any value being returned using the {\tt return}
statement, then a value of zero is returned.

Subroutines may serve one of two purposes. In many cases they are used to
implement complicated mathematical functions for which no simple algebraic
expression may be given. Secondly, they may be used to repetitively execute a
set of commands whenever they are required. In the latter case, the subroutine
may not have a return value, but may merely be used as a mechanism for
encapsulating a block of commands.  In this case, the \indcmdt{call} may be
used to execute a subroutine, discarding any return value which it may produce,
as in the example:

\vspace{3mm}
\noindent{\tt pyxplot>~{\bf subroutine f(x,y)}}\newline
\noindent{\tt subrtne>~~{\bf \{}}\newline
\noindent{\tt subrtne>~~~{\bf print "\%s - \%s = \%s"\%(x,y,x-y)}}\newline
\noindent{\tt subrtne>~~{\bf \}}}
\vspace{3mm}\newline
\noindent{\tt pyxplot> {\bf call f(2,1)}}\newline
\noindent{\tt 2 - 1 = 1}\newline
\noindent{\tt pyxplot> {\bf call f(5*unit(inch), 10*unit(mm))}}\newline

\example{ex:newton}{An image of a Newton fractal}{
Newton fractals are formed by iterating the equation
\begin{displaymath}
z_{n+1} = z_n - \frac{f(z_n)}{f^\prime(z_n)},
\end{displaymath}
subject to the starting condition that $z_0=c$, where $c$ is any complex number
$c$ and $f(z)$ is any mathematical function. This series is the Newton-Raphson
method for numerically finding solutions to the equation $f(z)=0$, and with
time usually converges towards one such solution for well-behaved functions.
The complex number $c$ represents the initial guess at the position of the
solution being sought. The Newton fractal is formed by asking which solution
the iteration converges upon, as a function of the position of the initial
guess $c$ in the complex plane. In the case of the cubic polynomial
$f(z)=z^3-1$, which has three solutions, a map might be generated with points
colored red, green or blue to represent convergence towards the three roots.
\nlnp
If $c$ is close to one of the roots, then convergence towards that particular
root is guaranteed, but further afield the map develops a fractal structure. In
this example, we define a PyXPlot subroutine to produce such a map as a
function of $c=x+iy$, and then plot the resulting map using the {\tt colormap}
plot style (see Section~\ref{sec:colormaps}).  To make the fractal prettier --
it contains, after all, only three colors as strictly defined -- we vary the
brightness of each point depending upon how many iterations are required before
the series ventures within a distance of $|z_n-r_i|<10^{-2}$ of any of the
roots $r_i$.

\example{ex:pendulum}{The dynamics of the simple pendulum}{
The equation of motion for a pendulum bob may be derived from the rotational
analogue to Newton's Second Law, $G=I\ddot\theta$ where $G$ is torque, $I$ is
moment of inertia and $\theta$ is the displacement of the pendulum bob from the
vertical. For a pendulum of length $l$, with a bob of mass $m$, this
equation becomes $-mgl\sin\theta=ml^2\ddot\theta$. In the small-angle
approximation, such that $\sin\theta\approx\theta$, it reduces to
the equation for simple harmonic motion, with the solution
\\ \noindent
\begin{equation}
\theta_\mathrm{approx}=\omega\sin\left(\sqrt{\frac{g}{l}}t\right).
\label{eq:pendulum_approx}
\end{equation}
\nlnp
A more exact solution requires integration of the second-order differential
equation of motion including the $\sin\theta$ term. This integral cannot be
done analytically, but the solution can be written in the form
\\ \noindent
\begin{equation}
\theta_\mathrm{exact}(t) = 2\sin^{-1}\left[ k\,\mathrm{sn}\left(\sqrt{\frac{g}{l}}t,k\right)\right].
\label{eq:pendulum_exact}
\end{equation}
\\ \noindent
where $\mathrm{sn}(u,m)$ is a Jacobi elliptic function and
$k=\sin\left(\omega/2\right)$.  The Jacobi elliptic function cannot be
analytically computed, but can be numerically approximated using the {\tt
jacobi\_\-sn(u,m)} function in PyXPlot.
\nlnp
Below, we produce a plot of Equations~(\ref{eq:pendulum_approx}) and
(\ref{eq:pendulum_exact}).  The horizontal axis is demarked in units of the
dimensionless period of the pendulum to eliminate $g$ and $l$, and a swing
amplitude of $\pm30^\circ$ is assumed:
\nlscf
\input{examples/tex/ex_pendulum_1.tex}
\nlscf
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=9cm]{examples/eps/ex_pendulum}}
\nlnp
As is apparent, at this amplitude, the exact solution begins to deviate
noticeably from the small-angle solution within 2--3 swings of the pendulum. We
now seek to quantify more precisely how long the two solutions take to diverge
by defining a subroutine to compute how long $T$ it takes before the two
solutions to deviate by some amount $\psi$. We then plot these times as a
function of amplitude $\omega$ for three deviation thresholds. Because this
subroutine takes a significant amount of time to run, we only compute~40
samples for each value of $\psi$:

\section{Macros}
\index{macros}
\index{@ operator@{\tt @} operator}

The $@$ operator can be used for literal substitution of the content of a
string variable into the command line.  The name of the string variable follows
the $@$ sign, and its content is expanded to the command line, as in this
example
\begin{verbatim}
mac = "with lines lw 2 lt 1"
plot sin(x) @mac
\end{verbatim}
which is equivalent to 
\begin{verbatim}
plot sin(x) with lines lw 2 lt 1
\end{verbatim}

The macro, being a string, can contain any characters, but as with other
variable names, the name of the macro can contain only alphanumeric characters
and the underscore sign. This also means that any operator, with the exception
of the {\tt and} and {\tt or} operators, can signify the end of the macro name,
without the need for a trailing white space. Therefore, in the example
\begin{verbatim}
foo = "50"
print @foo*3
\end{verbatim}
the end result is 150; {\tt 50*3} is passed to the command line interpreter.

One application of macros may be to supply arbitrary algebraic expressions for
later evaluation.

\example{ex:macro}{Using a macro to calculate the mean of a dataset}{
In this example, we create a subroutine which calculates the mean value of an
arbitrary function of the columns in a \datafile. The subroutine takes two
arguments: the name of the \datafile and a string containing the function to be
averaged.
\nlscf
\noindent{\tt subroutine mean(filename, func)}\newline
\noindent{\tt \phantom{x}\{}\newline
\noindent{\tt \phantom{xx}N\_data = 0}\newline
\noindent{\tt \phantom{xx}sum\_x  = 0}\newline
\\
\noindent{\tt \phantom{xx}foreach datum x in filename using $@$func}\newline
\noindent{\tt \phantom{xxx}\{}\newline
\noindent{\tt \phantom{xxxx}N\_data = N\_data + 1}\newline
\noindent{\tt \phantom{xxxx}sum\_x = sum\_x + x}\newline
\noindent{\tt \phantom{xxx}\}}\newline
\noindent{\tt \phantom{xxx}if(N\_data > 0) \{ ; return sum\_x / N\_data ; \} }\newline
\noindent{\tt \phantom{x}\}}\newline
\nlscf
This subroutine can be called from the command line as in the example
\newline\\ 
\noindent{\tt print mean('data.dat', "sin(\$1)*exp(\$2)")} 
\newline\\
where it returns the mean of the product of the sine of the first column, and
the exponential of the second column.
} 

\section{The \indcmdt{exec}}

The \indcmdt{exec} can be used to execute PyXPlot commands contained within
string variables. For example:

\begin{verbatim}
terminal="eps"
exec "set terminal %s"%(terminal)
\end{verbatim}

\noindent It can also be used to write obfuscated PyXPlot scripts, and its use
should be minimized wherever possible.

\section{Assertions}
\index{assertions}

The \indcmdt{assert} can be used to assert that a logical expression, such as
{\tt x>0}, is true. An error is reported if the expression is false, and
optionally a string can be supplied to provide a more informative error message
to the user:

\begin{verbatim}
assert x>0
assert y<0 "y must be less than zero."
\end{verbatim}

The \indcmdt{assert} can also be used to test the version number of PyXPlot. It
is possible to test either that the version is newer than or equal to a
specific version, using the {\tt $>$=} operator, or that it is older than a
specific version, using the {\tt $<$} operator, as demonstrated in the
following examples:

\begin{verbatim}
assert version >= 0.8.2
assert version <  0.8  "This script is designed for PyXPlot 0.7"
\end{verbatim}


\section{Shell commands}

Shell commands\index{shell commands!executing} may be executed directly from
within PyXPlot by prefixing them with an \indcmdts{!} character. The
remainder of the line is sent directly to the shell, for example:

\begin{verbatim}
!ls -l
\end{verbatim}

\noindent Semi-colons cannot be used to place further PyXPlot commands after a
shell command on the same line.

\begin{dontdo}
!ls -l ; set key top left
\end{dontdo}

It is also possible to substitute the output of a shell command into a PyXPlot
command. To do this, the shell command should be enclosed in back-quotes (`),
as in the following example:\index{backquote character}\index{shell
commands!substituting}

\begin{verbatim}
a=`ls -l *.ppl | wc -l`
print "The current directory contains %d PyXPlot scripts."%(a)
\end{verbatim}

It should be noted that back-quotes can only be used outside quotes. For
example,

\begin{dontdo}
set xlabel '`ls`'
\end{dontdo}

\noindent will not work. The best way to do this would be:

\begin{dodo}
set xlabel `echo "'" ; ls ; echo "'"`
\end{dodo}

Note that it is not possible to change the current working directory by sending
the {\tt cd} command to a shell, as this command would only change the working
directory of the shell in which the single command is executed:

\begin{dontdo}
!cd ..
\end{dontdo}

\noindent PyXPlot has its own \indcmdt{cd} for this purpose, as well as its own
\indcmdt{pwd}:

\begin{dodo}
cd ..
\end{dodo}

\section{Script watching: pyxplot\_watch}

PyXPlot includes a simple tool for watching command script files and executing
them whenever they are modified. This may be useful when developing a command
script, if one wants to make small modifications to it and see the results in a
semi-live fashion. This tool is invoked by calling the {\tt
pyxplot\_watch}\index{pyxplot\_watch}\index{watching scripts} command from a
shell prompt. The command-line syntax of {\tt pyxplot\_watch} is similar to
that of PyXPlot itself, for example:

\begin{verbatim}
pyxplot_watch script.ppl
\end{verbatim}

\noindent would set {\tt pyxplot\_watch} to watch the command script file
{\tt script.ppl}. One difference, however, is that if multiple script files are
specified on the command line, they are watched and executed independently,
\textit{not} sequentially, as PyXPlot itself would do. Wildcard characters can
also be used to set {\tt pyxplot\_watch} to watch multiple
files.\footnote{Note that {\tt pyxplot\_watch *.script} and
{\tt pyxplot\_watch $\backslash$*.script} will behave differently in most
UNIX shells.  In the first case, the wildcard is expanded by your shell, and a
list of files passed to {\tt pyxplot\_watch}. Any files matching the
wildcard, created after running {\tt pyxplot\_watch}, will not be picked up.
In the latter case, the wildcard is expanded by {\tt pyxplot\_watch} itself,
which {\it will} pick up any newly created files.}

This is especially useful when combined with \ghostview's\index{Ghostview}
watch facility. For example, suppose that a script {\tt foo.ppl} produces
PostScript output {\tt foo.ps}. The following two commands could be used to
give a live view of the result of executing this script:

\begin{verbatim}
gv --watch foo.ps &
pyxplot_watch foo.ppl
\end{verbatim}
