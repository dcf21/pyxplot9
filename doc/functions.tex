\funcdef{time\_\-fromunix({\it u})}{returns the Julian Day number corresponding to the specified Unix time $u$.}
\funcdef{time\_\-hour({\it JD})}{returns the integer hour of the day, in the range 0-23, in which the supplied Julian Day number falls. For more details see the {\tt time\_\-julianday()} function.}
\funcdef{time\_\-julianday({\it year},\-{\it month},\-{\it day},\-{\it hour},\-{\it min},\-{\it sec})}{returns the Julian Day number corresponding to the supplied time and date. Each field should be supplied numerically as an integer: for example, the {\it month} argument should be an integer in the range 1-12. In the default British calendar, the {\it year} argument should be the number of years elapsed since the Christian epoch. To enter dates before {\footnotesize AD\,1}, $0$ should be passed to indicate the year 1\,{\footnotesize BC}, $-1$ should be passed to indicate the year 2\,{\footnotesize BC}, and so forth. Dates may be entered in other calendars using the {\tt set calendar} command.

Julian Day numbers are defined to be the number of days elapsed since noon on 1st January, 4713\,{\footnotesize BC} in the Julian Calendar. Consequently, Julian Day numbers are rather large numbers: for example, midnight on 1st January 2000 corresponds to the Julian Day number 2451544.5. The hour of the day is indicated by the fractional part of the Julian Day number.

Julian Day numbers provide a useful means for analysing time-series data because they are not subject to the complicated non-decimal units in which time is conventionally measured. The task of calculating the time interval elapsed between two calendar dates is in general rather difficult, especially when leap years need be considered. However, the number of 24-hour periods elapsed between two Julian Day numbers is simply the numerical difference between the two day numbers.

PyXPlot's implementation of the {\tt time\_\-julianday()} function includes a consideration of the transition which was made from the Julian calendar to the Gregorian calendar on various dates in various countries. By default the transition is made at midnight on 14th~September 1752 (Gregorian calendar), when Britain and the British Empire adopted the Gregorian calendar. However, this may be changed using the {\tt set calendar} command.}

If no format string is provided, then the format \newline\noindent{\tt "\%a \%Y \%b \%d \%H:\%M:\%S"}\newline\noindent is used. In such format strings, the following tokens are substituted for various parts of the date:
